# Quality Gates & Validation Framework

## Overview

This document defines the quality gates and validation checklists for the Command & Agent System implementation. All code must pass these gates before being considered complete.

---

## 1. Definition of Done (DoD)

## 2. Code Review Checklist (Rust-Specific)

### Code Quality ✓
- [ ] **Naming:** Clear, descriptive variable/function names
- [ ] **Structure:** Logical code organization
- [ ] **Complexity:** Functions are reasonably small (<100 lines)
- [ ] **Duplication:** No copy-paste code, proper abstractions
- [ ] **Comments:** Complex logic is explained

### Rust Best Practices ✓
- [ ] **Error Handling:** `Result<T, E>` used, no `unwrap()` in prod code
- [ ] **Ownership:** Proper use of borrowing, no unnecessary clones
- [ ] **Lifetimes:** Lifetime annotations correct and minimal
- [ ] **Traits:** Appropriate trait usage, no over-engineering
- [ ] **Unsafe:** No unsafe blocks (or justified with SAFETY comment)
- [ ] **Generics:** Generic code is constrained appropriately

### Testing ✓
- [ ] **Coverage:** New code has ≥80% test coverage
- [ ] **Test Quality:** Tests are clear, independent, repeatable
- [ ] **Edge Cases:** Boundary conditions tested
- [ ] **Error Paths:** Error handling tested
- [ ] **Integration:** Integration tests for cross-module features

### Performance ✓
- [ ] **Algorithms:** Efficient algorithms used (O(n) vs O(n²))
- [ ] **Allocations:** Unnecessary allocations avoided
- [ ] **Cloning:** Clones justified, borrowing preferred
- [ ] **Async:** Async code doesn't block unnecessarily

### Security ✓
- [ ] **Input Validation:** User input validated and sanitized
- [ ] **execpolicy:** Command execution goes through policy
- [ ] **File Access:** File operations respect permissions
- [ ] **Dependencies:** New deps are vetted and necessary

### Project-Specific (Codex) ✓
- [ ] **TUI Style:** Follows `tui/styles.md` guidelines (if TUI code)
- [ ] **Permissions:** Agent permissions enforced (if agent code)
- [ ] **Templates:** Command templates validated (if command code)
- [ ] **Sandbox:** Sandbox boundaries respected

## 3. Testing Standards

### Unit Test Requirements
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_happy_path() {
        // Arrange
        let input = create_test_input();

        // Act
        let result = function_under_test(input);

        // Assert
        assert_eq!(result, expected_value);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_error_case() {
        let invalid_input = create_invalid_input();
        assert!(function_under_test(invalid_input).is_err());
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_edge_case() {
        // Test boundary conditions
        assert!(function_under_test(MIN_VALUE).is_ok());
        assert!(function_under_test(MAX_VALUE).is_ok());
    }
}
```

### Integration Test Requirements
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_command_execution_flow() {
    // Setup complete system
    let registry = CommandRegistry::new(test_dir()).await.unwrap();
    let expander = TemplateExpander::new();

    // Execute command
    let cmd = registry.get("explain").await.unwrap();
    let context = CommandContext::builder()
        .arg("code", "fn main() {}")
        .build();

    let expanded = expander.expand(
        ExplainCommand::template(),
        &context
    ).unwrap();

    // Validate result
    assert!(expanded.contains("fn main()"));
}
```

### Performance Benchmark Template
```rust
#[bench]
fn bench_template_expansion(b: &mut Bencher) {
    let expander = TemplateExpander::new();
    let context = create_benchmark_context();
    let template = ExplainCommand::template();

    b.iter(|| {
        expander.expand(template, &context)
    });
}
```

## 4. Performance Targets

### Command & Agent System

| Component | Target | Measurement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Command parsing | <10ms | Per command file |
| Registry lookup | <5ms | Per lookup |
| Template expansion | <50ms | Per expansion |
| Agent activation | <100ms | Per agent |
| Directory scan | <50ms | Per 100 files |
| Full command execution | <200ms | End-to-end |

### Validation Process
1. Run benchmarks: `cargo bench`
2. Compare to baseline
3. No >10% regression allowed
4. Document any optimizations

## 9. Issue Tracking & Resolution

### Severity Levels
- **P0 (Critical)**: Blocking, must fix immediately
- **P1 (High)**: Important, fix before release
- **P2 (Medium)**: Should fix, can defer to next sprint
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice to have, backlog

### Resolution Process
1. **Identify**: Log issue with severity
2. **Triage**: Assign owner and priority
3. **Fix**: Implement solution with tests
4. **Validate**: Run full quality gate checks
5. **Review**: Code review and approval
6. **Close**: Verify fix and update docs

---

## 10. Quality Gate Enforcement

### Gate Failure Actions
1. **Block merge** until all criteria met
2. **Document** reason for failure
3. **Assign** owner to resolve
4. **Track** in issue tracker
5. **Escalate** if blocked >24h

### Quality Sign-Off
Each sprint requires sign-off from:
- [ ] Engineering Lead (code quality)
- [ ] QA Lead (testing completeness)
- [ ] Security Lead (security validation)
- [ ] Product Owner (acceptance criteria)

---

## Conclusion

Quality is non-negotiable. All code must pass these gates before being considered complete. Use this framework throughout development to ensure consistent, high-quality delivery.

**Quality First. Always.**
